## Jikan is a Pomodoro Timer made in React.js and Redux

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student - <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Wikipedia</a>
